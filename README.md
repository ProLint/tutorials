# ProLint Tutorials

Tutorials on using and getting familiar with ProLint, specifically using the stand-alone python package `prolintpy`. 

There are two ways how you can do these tutorials.

1. Head over to the [prolintpy](https://github.com/ProLint/prolintpy) repository and launch the binders. You can then complete the tutorials within your browser without having to install anything. This is very convenient, however, note that currently the interactive applications have not been configured. 

2. Clone the repository, install the required packages and complete the tutorials by going through the notebooks. To install `prolintpy` you can either follow the instructions provided in the `prolintpy` repo, or you can use the provided `requirements.txt` file.
